<U> <h2><strong>The Road Till Now</strong></h2> </U> 
    <p>  
     I’m not new to taking on challenges, thinking on my feet and turning nothing into something magical. <br>in fact, its been my life. 
     most my life I have grown up in child safety, survived childhood trauma , extensive homelessness throughout my youth, lived in and out of different NGOs, families and households and to date- i felt there was many social & Economical hurdles i needed to overcome and i can safely say- i achieved just that, turned nothing into something magical. 
     <br>My vision was to become the change I wanted to see- and to be the man in the suit for the right reasons. Now my life’s mission is the be the voice for those that have yet to find theirs, to help my clients and employees unlock their potential- to help them achieve their goals, to steer their generation in a different direction. I believe I have the best of both worlds - both theoretical and practical understanding of our clients, resilience to working under pressure, thinking quickly on my toes, and using the transferable skills life has taught me, and implement it into my work. <br> 
     within working as a public servant i Have over 10 years’ experience in liaising with stakeholders and clients, I am passionate for advocating on behalf of our clients and company whilst building and maintain positive relationships & Repuation for our company & myself. 
     I hold a Certificate IV in Business Management &also am currently studying a bachelor of Clinical Psychology & also undertaking the University of Adelaide’s Coding boot camp. 
     <br>I have Strong interpersonal skills, a can do, problem- solving attitude, and a passion for helping people are my distinctive traits I apply to new challenges. 
     As a proven proficient communicator, I assist my stakeholders, employees and clients with honesty and integrity. As a thorough, determined Leader& worker, I am an excellent candidate for high Function roles, requiring a high-level of attention to detail, responsibility, Leadership and time-management skills and can make sure our company’s KPIS are met while making sure we meet our clients goals and supporting my team thoroughly in the process.
